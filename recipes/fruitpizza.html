        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask Mom for fruit pizza for birthday and all holidays</li>
            <li>Sugar cookie crust. To get started, lightly grease a round pizza pan with non-stick spray. Press the dough into the pan. You’ll want the crust about 1/8 inch thick. Pierce the dough a couple times with a fork. Bake at 350°F for 8-10 minutes, until edges are lightly golden. Then let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Cream cheese frosting. While the crust is baking, make the cream cheese frosting. In a large bowl, whip together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Then fold in the cool whip. Once the cookie crust has cooled, spread the frosting evenly on top using a spatula.

            </li>
            <li>Fruit topping. Now it’s time to top with your favorite fruit! We love to use raspberries, strawberries, mandarin oranges, kiwi, bananas, cherry pie filling, peach pie filling, etc. If using canned fruit, make sure to drain any excess liquid so the crust doesn’t get soggy.</li>
            <li>Enjoy scrumptious homemade fruit pizza</li>
            <li>Try not to eat the entire thing in one sitting.</li>
        </ol>
